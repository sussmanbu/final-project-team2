We finished the Data Equity part. 

We thinked about 3-4 principles of how they could be relevant to our US Police Fatalities dataset. These principles help our data set to be used ethically and constructively.

The main aspect of our data principles is the potential for abuse or misuse based on the potential biased narratives in our dataset

We start to do a few data analysis and start thinking about how to construct our data plan
