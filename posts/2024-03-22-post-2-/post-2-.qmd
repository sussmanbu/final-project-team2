We are working with the US Police Fatalities data set. For this post, we 
	Set up data loading and cleaning in the load_and_clean_data.R file. The required rds file was created. Since the data set we found was already cleaned, we did not do anything specific to clean the data further.
	
	Answer all the questions from the data background part and update it to the data page in the website. 

	Write some paragraphs about data equity.(still working on it, so this is not updated).
