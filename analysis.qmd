This comes from the file `analysis.qmd`.

We describe here our detailed data analysis. This page will provide an
overview of what questions you addressed, illustrations of relevant
aspects of the data with tables and figures, and a statistical model
that attempts to answer part of the question. You'll also reflect on
next steps and further analysis.

The audience for this page is someone like your class mates, so you can
expect that they have some level of statistical and quantitative
sophistication and understand ideas like linear and logistic regression,
coefficients, confidence intervals, overfitting, etc.

While the exact number of figures and tables will vary and depend on
your analysis, you should target around 5 to 6. An overly long analysis
could lead to losing points. If you want you can link back to your blog
posts or create separate pages with more details.

The style of this paper should aim to be that of an academic paper. I
don't expect this to be of publication quality but you should keep that
aim in mind. Avoid using "we" too frequently, for example "We also found
that ...". Describe your methodology and your findings but don't
describe your whole process.

### Example of loading data

The code below shows an example of loading the loan refusal data set
(which you should delete at some point).

```{r}
# library(tidyverse)
# print(getwd())
# data <- read_csv(here::here("dataset/loan_refusal_clean.csv"))
# load(here::here("dataset/loan_refusal.RData"))
# print(ls())
```

## Introduction 

In recent years, police-related fatalities have become a focal point of
public and academic debate, underscoring critical concerns about racial
disparities within law enforcement across the United States. This
analysis seeks to explore the extent to which racial disparity,
especially against Black individuals, contributes to the demographics of
these fatalities. The urgency of this issue is amplified by ongoing
societal calls for justice and reform, making it essential to understand
the patterns and factors that drive these disparities.

#Thesis Statement This research posits that racial disparity is a
significant factor influencing the demographics of police-related
fatalities, with Black individuals experiencing disproportionately high
mortality rates in comparison to other races across various cities.

### Research Questions 

To provide a structured exploration of this issue, this analysis will
address the following key questions:

i.  How do mortality rates from police-related fatalities among Black
    individuals compare to those of other races across different cities?

ii. What factors might contribute to any observed disparities in these
    mortality rates?

iii. Are there specific geographic or demographic contexts in which
     these disparities are more pronounced?

### Significance of the Analysis 

The findings of this analysis are intended to contribute to the broader
dialogue on racial equity and law enforcement practices. By examining
the intersection of race and police-related fatalities, this study aims
to provide data-driven insights that could inform policy decisions and
advocacy efforts aimed at reducing these disparities. Additionally, this
analysis will serve as an educational resource for scholars,
policymakers, and the public, fostering a deeper understanding of how
racial dynamics shape outcomes in law enforcement encounters.

Through a combination of quantitative methods and statistical modeling,
this analysis page will offer a detailed examination of the available
data, aiming to present a clear and comprehensive picture of how race
influences the risk of fatality in police interactions. The next
sections will describe the data used for this analysis, the methodology
employed, and the results obtained,thereby framing the context for a
rigorous discussion on this critical social issue.

## Data Description 

This analysis leverages two key datasets:

Police Fatality Dataset & U.S. Cities Demographic Dataset

To load the dataset, run the attached R script "combining-datasets.R".

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
source("combining-datasets.R")
rm(police_f,us_dem,us_dem_wid)
```

After running this R script, the two datasets we used will be merged,
cleared and loaded into your environment called police_dem. For more
information on these two datasets and merging process, see the data
page. [data
page](https://sussmanbu.github.io/final-project-team2/data.html).

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Started by exploring the distribution of police-related fatalities by
race.

```{r}
fatalities_by_race <- police_dem |>
  group_by(Race) |>
  summarize(Fatalities = n()) |>
  ungroup()

ggplot(fatalities_by_race, aes(x = reorder(Race, -Fatalities), y = Fatalities, fill = Race)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(
    title = "Distribution of Police-Related Fatalities by Race",
    x = "Race",
    y = "Number of Fatalities"
  ) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

As expected, the highest number of deaths occurred among blacks or
African Americans.

The next step is to compare this with demographic data, and it would be
interesting to examine the relationship between each racial group's
percentage of total deaths and their percentage of the total population
of the sampled city. This would help to determine how specific racial
groups are disproportionately affected.

```{r}
fatalities_by_race_city_state <- police_dem |>
  group_by(State, City, Race) |>
  summarize(Fatalities = n(), .groups = 'drop')

population_by_race_city_state <- police_dem |>
  group_by(State, City) |>
  summarise(
    White = first(White),
    `Black or African-American` = first(`Black or African-American`),
    `Hispanic or Latino` = first(`Hispanic or Latino`),
    Asian = first(Asian),
    `American Indian and Alaska Native` = first(`American Indian and Alaska Native`),
    .groups = 'drop'
  )|>
  pivot_longer(cols = -c(City, State), names_to = "Race", values_to = "Population")

comparison_df <- 
  left_join(fatalities_by_race_city_state, population_by_race_city_state, by = c("State", "City", "Race"))|>
  mutate(
    FatalityPercentage = (Fatalities / sum(Fatalities)) * 100,
    PopulationPercentage = (Population / sum(Population)) * 100,
    diffinPercentage = FatalityPercentage - PopulationPercentage
  )|>
  arrange(desc(diffinPercentage))

```

```{r}
sum_df<- comparison_df|>
  group_by(Race)|>
  summarise(sumfatalityp = sum(FatalityPercentage),
          sumpopulationp = sum(PopulationPercentage))|>
  pivot_longer(cols = c(sumfatalityp, sumpopulationp), names_to = "Type", values_to = "Percentage") %>%
  mutate(Type = recode(Type, 'sumfatalityp' = 'Fatality Percentage', 'sumpopulationp' = 'Population Percentage'))

ggplot(sum_df, aes(x = Type, y = Percentage, fill = Type)) +
  geom_col(position = position_dodge(width = 0.8)) +
  facet_wrap(~ Race) +
  labs(
    title = "Comparison of Fatality and Population Percentages by Race",
    x = NULL,
    y = "Percentage"
  ) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("Fatality Percentage" = "red", "Population Percentage" = "blue")) +
  theme(
    axis.text.x = element_blank(),  
    axis.ticks.x = element_blank(), 
    strip.background = element_blank(),
    strip.text.x = element_text(size = 10)
  ) 


```

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidycensus)
library(sf)
```

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
states_sf <- get_decennial(geography = "state", 
                           year = 2020, 
                           variables = "H1_001N", 
                           geometry = TRUE)
```

```{r}
state_level_comparison_df <- comparison_df %>%
  group_by(State, Race) %>%
  summarize(Diff_Percentage = mean(diffinPercentage, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = 'drop')

state_data_sf <- inner_join(states_sf, state_level_comparison_df, by = c("NAME" = "State"))
```

```{r}
state_data_sf %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_sf(aes(fill = Diff_Percentage), color = NA) +
  scale_fill_gradient2(
    low = "blue", mid = "white", high = "red",  # Adjust colors if needed
    midpoint = 0, 
    limit = c(min(state_data_sf$Diff_Percentage, na.rm = TRUE), max(state_data_sf$Diff_Percentage, na.rm = TRUE)), 
    name = "Diff in Percentage",
    na.value = "white"
  ) +
  facet_wrap(~ Race) +
  labs(
    title = "Difference in Police Fatality and Population Percentages by Race and State",
    subtitle = "Faceted by Race",
    fill = "Diff in Percentage"
  ) +
  theme_void() +
  theme(
    legend.position = "bottom",
    plot.title = element_text(size = 14, hjust = 0.5), 
    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 12),
    strip.text = element_text(size = 10)  # Adjust facet label text size
  ) +
  coord_sf(xlim = c(-125, -67), ylim = c(24, 50), expand = FALSE)

```

As shown in the graph, both White and Hispanic has a smaller police
fatality rate comparing to the population percentage. However, for Blan
or African-American, there is a higher police fatality rate than the
population percentage comparing to other races.

## Modelling

```{r}
model_data<- police_dem|>
  group_by(City)|>
  summarise(Fatalities = n(),
            Median.Age = first(Median.Age),
            Male.Population = first(Male.Population),
            Female.Population = first(Female.Population),
            Foreign.born = first(Foreign.born),
            Average.Household.Size = first(Average.Household.Size),
            White = first(White),
            `Black or African-American` = first(`Black or African-American`),
            `Hispanic or Latino` = first(`Hispanic or Latino`),
            Asian = first(Asian),
            `American Indian and Alaska Native` = first(`American Indian and Alaska Native`)
            )|>
  arrange(desc(Fatalities))
model_data <- na.omit(model_data)
print(model_data)
write.csv(model_data, "model_data.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```

```{r}
# Loading necessary libraries
library(dplyr)
library(randomForest)
library(caret)

# Reading CSV
model_data <- read.csv("model_data.csv")

# Preprocessing
features <- c("Median.Age", "Average.Household.Size", "White", "Black.or.African.American",
              "Hispanic.or.Latino", "Asian", "Foreign.born")
X <- model_data[features]
y <- model_data$Fatalities

set.seed(42)
train_indices <- createDataPartition(y, p=0.8, list=FALSE)
X_train <- X[train_indices, ]
y_train <- y[train_indices]
X_test <- X[-train_indices, ]
y_test <- y[-train_indices]

# Models to compare
models <- c("lm", "rf", "gbm") # Linear regression, random forest, and gradient boosted trees

# Training models and collecting results
results <- lapply(models, function(model_type) {
    model <- train(X_train, y_train, method=model_type, trControl=trainControl(method="cv", number=5))
    preds <- predict(model, X_test)
    mse <- mean((y_test - preds)^2)
    r2 <- cor(y_test, preds)^2
    list(model=model, mse=mse, r2=r2, preds=preds)
})

# Storing results in a list for later access
results_named <- setNames(results, models)

# Comparing model results as a summary
comparison_table <- data.frame(
    Model=names(results_named),
    MSE=sapply(results_named, function(res) res$mse),
    R2=sapply(results_named, function(res) res$r2)
)

print(comparison_table)

# Tuning the random forest model
tuneGrid <- expand.grid(mtry = c(3, 4, 5))
rf_tuned <- train(X_train, y_train, method="rf", trControl=trainControl(method="cv", number=5), tuneGrid=tuneGrid)

print(rf_tuned)

```

According to this result, it is shown that the third model, GBM
(Gradient Boosting Model) has the highest R2 value and lowest MSE, which
make this model the optimal choice for our research, now we will refine
and improve this model.

```{r}
# Loading necessary libraries
library(dplyr)
library(randomForest)
library(caret)
library(gbm)

# Reading the CSV file
model_data <- read.csv("model_data.csv")

# Preprocessing
features <- c("White", "Black.or.African.American", "Hispanic.or.Latino", "Asian", "American.Indian.and.Alaska.Native")
X <- model_data[features]
y <- model_data$Fatalities

# Splitting data
set.seed(42)
train_indices = createDataPartition(y, p=0.8, list=FALSE)
X_train = X[train_indices, ]
y_train = y[train_indices]
X_test = X[-train_indices, ]
y_test = y[-train_indices]

# Define the tuning grid
tuneGrid_gbm = expand.grid(
    interaction.depth = c(1, 2, 3),
    n.trees = c(50, 100, 150),
    shrinkage = c(0.1, 0.05),
    n.minobsinnode = c(10, 20)
)

train_control = trainControl(method="cv", number=5, verboseIter=FALSE)

# Training the model
gbm_tuned = train(X_train, y_train, method="gbm", trControl=train_control, tuneGrid=tuneGrid_gbm)

# Extracting importance directly
importance <- relative.influence(gbm_tuned$finalModel)

# Converting to a data frame
importance_df <- data.frame(Feature=names(importance), Relative_Influence=importance)

# Plotting graph with labels
ggplot(importance_df, aes(x=reorder(Feature, Relative_Influence), y=Relative_Influence)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity", fill="blue") +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title="Relative Influence of Features", x="Features", y="Relative Influence")

```

As we can see in the chart, Black has the lowest relative influence on
the prediction, which may contradict our findings. However, there are a
few explanations: "Influence" reflects how much each feature contributes
to the model's predictive power, but might not directly correlate with a
feature's impact in the real world. Complex interactions between
demographics and fatalities might not align directly with simple
correlations. Which means there are still more work need to be done in
order to prefectly predict with this model.

```{r}
# Convert all columns except 'City' to numeric
numeric_columns <- c("Fatalities", "Median.Age", "Male.Population", "Female.Population",
                     "Foreign.born", "Average.Household.Size", "White", "Black.or.African.American",
                     "Hispanic.or.Latino", "Asian", "American.Indian.and.Alaska.Native")

model_data[numeric_columns] <- lapply(model_data[numeric_columns], as.numeric)

# Checking correlation
correlations <- cor(model_data[numeric_columns])
print(correlations)

cor_black_fatalities <- cor.test(model_data$Fatalities, model_data$Black.or.African.American)
print(cor_black_fatalities)
```

According to the summarization above, the correlation analysis reveals a
moderate positive relationship between the "Black or African-American"
demographic and fatality rates, with a correlation of 0.35 and a p-value
indicating statistical significance. This suggests that as the
percentage of this demographic increases, fatality rates tend to
increase as well. However, the "Hispanic or Latino" demographic shows a
higher correlation with fatalities, at 0.65. The feature importance
results from the GBM model reflect these relationships, with "Black or
African-American" ranking fourth in influence. These findings offer
insights into how different demographic features contribute to
predicting fatality rates.
